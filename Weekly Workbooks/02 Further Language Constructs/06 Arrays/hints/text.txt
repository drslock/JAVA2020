In order to fill your array with a random selection of shapes, you may like to make use of the Java "Random" method:

`Math.random()`

This will return a randomly selected double precision floating point number (between 0.0 and 1.0).
You will need to write an IF statement to look at this number and decide which shape to create.

In order to count the number of triangles, you'll need an integer counter variable.
You might also like to make use the `instanceof` operator !
